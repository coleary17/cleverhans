## What's Left to Build ‚ùå

### CTC Attack Optimization ‚ö†Ô∏è
**CTC attack is working but needs fine-tuning for full effectiveness**

### Specific Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **CTC Attack Refinement** (IN PROGRESS)
**Current Status**: Attack shows strong signs of working but produces short outputs
- ‚úÖ Gradient flow confirmed (2404.9556 grad norm)
- ‚úÖ Loss decreasing (-15.0271 ‚Üí -17.2074)
- ‚úÖ Model responding (producing 'y', 'w' characters vs empty strings)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need full target sentence generation instead of single characters
- üîß Parameter tuning required for learning rates and perturbation bounds

**Next Steps**:
- Fine-tune learning rate scheduling for more stable convergence
- Experiment with different perturbation bound values (currently 0.1)
- Optimize CTC loss formulation for better target alignment
- Test different wav2vec2 model sizes (base ‚Üí large ‚Üí large-lv60)

#### 2. **Whisper Gradient Flow Problem** (BLOCKED)
**Issue**: Whisper's preprocessing pipeline breaks computational graph
- `WhisperProcessor` converts audio to spectrograms in non-differentiable way
- Gradients cannot flow back from loss to audio perturbations
- Loss values remain constant across optimization iterations
- Perturbations are not updated, resulting in zero distortion

**Evidence**:
```
Stage 1 - Iteration 0, Loss: 8.0839
Stage 1 - Iteration 100, Loss: 8.0839  # No change
Stage 1 - Iteration 1000, Loss: 8.0839 # Still no change
Stage 1 distortion: 0.00               # No perturbation applied
```

#### 3. **Attack Effectiveness Validation**
**Partially Complete**: Basic framework exists, needs systematic evaluation
- ‚úÖ Working CTC attack with measurable perturbations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need measurement of transcription accuracy changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need comparison between original and adversarial transcriptions  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need success rate metrics across different audio samples

#### 4. **Stage 2 Psychoacoustic Masking**
**Status**: Framework exists, ready for integration with working CTC attack  
- ‚úÖ Masking threshold computation implemented
- ‚úÖ PSD calculations and frequency domain analysis working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need integration with successful CTC Stage 1 results
