## What's Left to Build ‚ùå

### Critical Missing Component: Effective Adversarial Perturbations
**The core attack mechanism is not yet functional**

### Specific Technical Challenges

#### 1. **Gradient Flow Problem** (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Whisper's preprocessing pipeline breaks computational graph
- `WhisperProcessor` converts audio to spectrograms in non-differentiable way
- Gradients cannot flow back from loss to audio perturbations
- Loss values remain constant across optimization iterations
- Perturbations are not updated, resulting in zero distortion

**Evidence**:
```
Stage 1 - Iteration 0, Loss: 8.0839
Stage 1 - Iteration 100, Loss: 8.0839  # No change
Stage 1 - Iteration 1000, Loss: 8.0839 # Still no change
Stage 1 distortion: 0.00               # No perturbation applied
```

#### 2. **Attack Effectiveness Validation**
**Missing**: Systematic evaluation of attack success
- No measurement of transcription accuracy changes
- No comparison between original and adversarial transcriptions
- No success rate metrics across different audio samples

#### 3. **Stage 2 Implementation**
**Status**: Framework exists but not yet utilized
- Psychoacoustic masking integration incomplete
- No imperceptibility optimization in current pipeline
- Missing masking threshold application to perturbations

### Required Engineering Solutions

#### Option 1: Custom Differentiable Loss Function
- Bypass Whisper's preprocessing entirely
- Implement custom spectrogram computation with gradients
- Create simplified acoustic model for gradient computation
- **Complexity**: High - requires deep understanding of Whisper internals

#### Option 2: Surrogate Model Approach  
- Train smaller, fully-differentiable model to approximate Whisper
- Use surrogate for gradient computation, validate on real Whisper
- Transfer attack from surrogate to target model
- **Complexity**: High - requires training additional models

#### Option 3: Gradient-Free Optimization
- Replace gradient-based optimization with evolutionary algorithms
- Use genetic algorithms, particle swarm, or other metaheuristics
- Slower but doesn't require gradients
- **Complexity**: Medium - changes optimization strategy

#### Option 4: Advanced Gradient Techniques
- Implement differentiable approximations of Whisper preprocessing
- Use techniques like straight-through estimators
- Careful gradient flow management through complex pipelines
- **Complexity**: Very High - cutting-edge research territory
