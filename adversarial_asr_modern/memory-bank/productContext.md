# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Original Research Significance
The 2017 adversarial ASR attack by Carlini & Wagner demonstrated that audio adversarial examples could fool automatic speech recognition systems. This was groundbreaking research showing vulnerabilities in AI systems that process audio input.

### Modernization Necessity
The original implementation became obsolete due to:
- **Python 2 End-of-Life**: Original code written in Python 2.7 (deprecated 2020)
- **TensorFlow 1.x Deprecation**: Used TensorFlow 1.14 (no longer supported)
- **Lingvo Model Unavailability**: Original ASR model difficult to obtain/run
- **Dependency Hell**: Complex manual dependency management

### Problems This Project Solves

#### 1. **Research Reproducibility Crisis**
- Original adversarial audio research inaccessible to modern researchers
- Critical security research locked behind obsolete technology stack
- Knowledge loss as original implementation becomes unusable

#### 2. **Modern ASR Vulnerability Assessment**
- OpenAI Whisper is now ubiquitous in ASR applications
- Need to understand if modern ASR systems have similar vulnerabilities
- Security implications for voice-controlled systems, transcription services

#### 3. **Educational Access**
- Students and researchers need working examples of adversarial audio attacks
- Demonstrations of gradient-based optimization in audio domain
- Understanding psychoacoustic masking for imperceptible perturbations

## How It Should Work

### Target User Experience
1. **Researchers**: Clone repository, run single command, get adversarial audio examples
2. **Students**: Use as educational tool to understand adversarial ML concepts
3. **Security Practitioners**: Assess ASR system vulnerabilities in their applications
4. **Developers**: Integrate adversarial testing into ASR system validation

### Expected Functionality
- **Input**: Original audio file + target transcription text
- **Process**: Two-stage optimization (effectiveness + imperceptibility)
- **Output**: Modified audio file that transcribes to target text but sounds identical to original

### Success Metrics
- **Effectiveness**: High success rate in fooling Whisper transcription
- **Imperceptibility**: Human listeners cannot distinguish original from adversarial audio
- **Efficiency**: Reasonable computation time on standard hardware
- **Accessibility**: Easy setup and execution for researchers

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Plug-and-Play Simplicity**: Single Docker command execution
2. **Clear Results**: Obvious demonstration of attack success/failure
3. **Educational Value**: Code structured for learning and experimentation
4. **Reproducibility**: Identical results across different environments

### Secondary Goals
1. **Extensibility**: Easy to modify for different ASR models
2. **Scalability**: Can process larger datasets with minor configuration changes
3. **Debugging Support**: Clear error messages and intermediate output inspection
4. **Performance Options**: Both CPU (development) and GPU (production) support

## Current Status vs. Goals

### ‚úÖ **Achieved Goals**
- **Technical Modernization**: Full Python 3 + PyTorch implementation
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment working on ARM64 and x86_64
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, well-documented codebase
