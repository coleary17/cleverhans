# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**COMPLETED**: Full modernization of 2017 adversarial ASR attack system. System is functionally complete but blocked by gradient flow issue that prevents successful attacks against Whisper.

## Recent Changes (Last 10 Events)
1. **2025-08-03 22:35** - Completed comprehensive system modernization and debugging
2. **2025-08-03 17:00** - Identified and documented critical gradient flow problem preventing attacks
3. **2025-08-03 16:45** - Fixed all tensor conversion errors and API compatibility issues  
4. **2025-08-03 16:30** - Successfully processed all 10 LibriSpeech samples with clear output
5. **2025-08-03 16:15** - Implemented proper loss computation with Whisper integration
6. **2025-08-03 16:00** - Fixed audio scaling issues that were breaking Whisper transcription
7. **2025-08-03 15:45** - Created working debug tools for Whisper transcription testing
8. **2025-08-03 15:30** - Resolved all librosa API compatibility issues
9. **2025-08-03 15:15** - Fixed Whisper processor integration errors
10. **2025-08-03 15:00** - Completed end-to-end pipeline with proper error handling

## Next Steps
**CRITICAL CHALLENGE**: Solve gradient flow problem where Whisper's preprocessing breaks computational graph needed for adversarial optimization. Three potential approaches:
1. **Custom Differentiable Loss**: Create loss function that bypasses Whisper preprocessing
2. **Surrogate Model**: Train simpler model to approximate Whisper for gradient computation  
3. **Gradient-Free Optimization**: Use evolutionary algorithms instead of gradient-based methods

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **COMPLETED**: Full system modernization (Python 2→3, TF→PyTorch, lingvo→Whisper)
- **COMPLETED**: ARM64 Docker compatibility for M-series Mac development
- **COMPLETED**: UV package management with 77 clean dependencies
- **BLOCKED**: Gradient flow through Whisper's feature extraction pipeline
- **WORKING**: All components except actual adversarial perturbation generation

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between audio utils, masking, and attack logic
- **Device Agnostic**: Automatic CPU/GPU detection with ARM64 compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and debugging tools
- **Documentation**: Complete memory bank system for knowledge preservation
- **Testing**: 10 LibriSpeech samples for validation and debugging

## Project Insights
- **Architecture Migration Success**: Successfully adapted TF 1.x session-based code to PyTorch
- **Whisper Integration Challenge**: Preprocessing pipeline fundamentally incompatible with gradient flow
- **Two-Stage Framework**: Stage 1 (optimization) works but ineffective, Stage 2 (masking) ready
- **Core Research Value**: Demonstrates feasibility of modernizing 2017 adversarial audio research
- **Technical Debt**: Gradient flow solution will require advanced ML engineering techniques
